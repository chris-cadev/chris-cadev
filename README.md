## State of mind (2023-03-09)
As a software engineer, I am acutely aware of the impact that technology has on our world. While technology can provide tremendous benefits, it can also have negative consequences if not designed and used responsibly. For instance, poorly designed software can be frustrating and confusing for users, negatively impacting their experience and productivity. Furthermore, technology can consume vast amounts of energy and resources, contributing to climate change and environmental degradation.

Therefore, I believe it is essential to approach software development with a sense of responsibility and a desire to make the world a better place. This means designing software with the user's needs and experiences in mind, as well as considering the broader environmental impact of our work. I am passionate about creating software that not only solves problems but also does so in a way that aligns with our values and supports a sustainable future. I am committed to staying informed about the latest developments in technology and their impact on our world, so that I can continually improve my work and make a positive difference.
